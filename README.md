## 🧠 Overview

The **Smart Parking System** is an IoT-based project that monitors parking lot occupancy in real-time and provides an efficient way for users to identify available parking spots. It helps reduce the time and fuel wasted in searching for parking by leveraging sensors, microcontrollers, and real-time data visualization.

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time parking space detection
- Live monitoring via web/mobile interface
- Automated slot status updates (Occupied/Vacant)
- Low-power and cost-efficient solution
- Easy to deploy and scale

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32)
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
- IR sensors (optional for gate management)
- LEDs or LCD for slot status display
- Jumper wires, resistors, and breadboard
- Power supply

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C / MicroPython
- Blynk App or custom Web Dashboard
- MQTT broker (optional)
- Firebase / Google Sheets / Local server for data storage

## 🗺️ System Architecture

[Car] --> [Ultrasonic Sensor] --> [NodeMCU/ESP] --> [Wi-Fi] --> [Cloud / Server] --> [User App or Web Interface]


Each parking slot is equipped with a sensor. The NodeMCU gathers data from these sensors and transmits it via Wi-Fi to a server or cloud platform, which updates the dashboard or app interface accordingly.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. A vehicle approaches a parking slot.
2. The ultrasonic sensor detects its presence.
3. The NodeMCU updates the slot status as "Occupied".
4. Data is sent to the cloud platform in real time.
5. Users can view slot availability through the app/web dashboard.
6. When the car leaves, the status is updated to "Vacant".

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Connect Hardware:**
   - Attach ultrasonic sensors to NodeMCU GPIO pins.
   - Set up LEDs (optional) to show status locally.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Use Arduino IDE to upload the program to the NodeMCU.
   - Configure Wi-Fi SSID and password in the code.

3. **Dashboard/App Setup:**
   - Use Blynk, Firebase, or a local web interface to display real-time data.

4. **Run & Monitor:**
   - Power up the system.
   - Use serial monitor or dashboard to view slot statuses.
